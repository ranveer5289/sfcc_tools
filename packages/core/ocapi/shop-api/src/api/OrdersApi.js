See dw.order.hooks.PaymentHooks.authorize(order : Order, paymentDetails : OrderPaymentInstrument) : Status.      What is the dw.order.OrderPaymentInstrument input argument passed to the hook?      If the request contains a customer_payment_instrument_id the  dw.order.OrderPaymentInstrument is copied from the customer payment instrument (An exception is thrown  if none was found).  Otherwise the data from the request document is passed (payment_card or  payment_bank_account etc. information).      Note: the amount and the security_code (cvn) contained in the  payment_card data will be propagated if available to  dw.order.payment.authorizeCreditCard even if the dw.order.OrderPaymentInstrument is  resolved from a customer payment instrument.      Customization hook dw.ocapi.shop.order.afterPostPaymentInstrument is called. The default  implementation places the order if the order status is CREATED and the authorization amount equals or exceeds the  order total. Placing the order (equivalent to calling dw.order.OrderMgr.placeOrder(order : Order) in the  scripting API) results in the order being changed to status NEW and prepared for export.
