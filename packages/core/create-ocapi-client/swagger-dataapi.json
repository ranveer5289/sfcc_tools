Attributes are grouped\n into different buckets.  These are the list of searchable attributes with their corresponding buckets:\n\n Main:\n \n    id - String\n    name - String\n    online - SiteSpecific Boolean\n    searchable - SiteSpecific Boolean \n    valid_from - SiteSpefic DateTime \n    valid_to - SiteSpecfic DateTime \n    type - ProductType \n    creation_date - DateTime\n \n Catalog:\n \n    catalog_id - String\n \n Category:\n \n    category_id - String\n \n Special:\n \n    type - {\"item\", \"set, \"bundle\", \"master\", \"part_of_product_set\", \"bundled\", \"variant\", \"variation_group\", \"option\", \"retail_set\", \"part_of_retail_set\"}\n \n\n The sortable properties are:\n \n id - String\n name - String\n creation_date - DateTime\n \n\n Note that catalog_id is the id of the catalog to which products are assigned to.\n\n Only attributes in the same bucket can be joined using a disjunction (OR).\n For instance, when joining id and catalog_id above, only a conjunction is allowed (AND), whereas id\n and searchable can be joined using a disjunction because they are in the same bucket.  If an attribute\n is used in a disjunction (OR) that violates this rule, an exception will be thrown.\n\n The product search retrieves additional properties of the product when expansions are used.\n\tThe available expand attribute values are:\n \n        \t'all' will retrieve all the product properties.\n          'availability' will retrieve the following properties:\n            ats\n            in_stock\n            online\n\t\t    \n          'categories' will retrieve the following properties:\n            assigned_categories\n\t\t\t\n          'images' will retrieve the following properties:\n            image\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t'all_images' used with images will retrieve the following properties:\n            image\n            image_groups\n\t\t\t\n          'prices' will retrieve the following properties:\n            price\n            price_currency\n\t\t\t\n          'sets' will retrieve the following properties:\n            set_products\n            product_sets\n\t\t\t\n          'bundles' will retrieve the following properties:\n            product_bundles\n            bundled_products\n            \n\t\t\t\n\n ","operationId":"postProductSearch","parameters":[{"in":"body","name":"body","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/search_request"}},{"description":"The site context.","in":"query","name":"site_id","type":"string"}],"responses":{"400":{"description":"Indicates the search query is ill-formed."},"default":{"description":"","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/product_search_result"}}},"security":[{"oauth2_application":[]}],"tags":["product_search"]}},"/products/{id}":{"delete":{"description":"Deletes the product by ID","operationId":"deleteProductsByID","parameters":[{"description":"The product ID.","in":"path","maxLength":100,"minLength":1,"name":"id","required":true,"type":"string"}],"responses":{"204":{"description":""},"404":{"description":"Indicates the product is not found."}},"security":[{"oauth2_application":[]}],"tags":["products"]},"get":{"description":"Action to get product information.","operationId":"getProductsByID","parameters":[{"description":"The product ID.","in":"path","minLength":1,"name":"id","required":true,"type":"string"},{"in":"query","name":"site_id","type":"string"},{"in":"query","items":{"type":"string"},"name":"expand","type":"array"}],"responses":{"404":{"description":"Indicates the product is not found."},"default":{"description":"","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/product"}}},"security":[{"oauth2_application":[]}],"tags":["products"]},"patch":{"description":"Update a product using the information provided.\n\n Fields that can be updated:\n name, page_description, long_descripton, page_title,\n page_keywords, brand, ean,upc, manufacture_sku,\n manufacture_name, searchable, unit, searchable,\n online_flag, default_variant_id.","operationId":"patchProductsByID","parameters":[{"description":"The product ID.","in":"path","maxLength":100,"minLength":1,"name":"id","required":true,"type":"string"},{"in":"body","name":"body","required":true,"schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/product"}}],"responses":{"400":{"description":"Indicates there is a problem to set default variant for a product. or Indicates the ID in request URL does not match the ID in the product document."},"404":{"description":"Indicates the product to be updated is not found."},"default":{"description":"","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/product"}}},"security":[{"oauth2_application":[]}],"tags":["products"]},"put":{"description":"Creates a product using the information provided.
